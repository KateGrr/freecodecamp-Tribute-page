                <li><h3>1906-1930: Early Years and Academic Pursuits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was born on December 9, 1906, in New York City. Growing up, she developed a keen interest in mathematics and problem-solving.</li>
                        <li>In 1928, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Vassar College.</li>
                        <li>Hopper continued her studies at Yale University, earning her master's degree in mathematics in 1930.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>1943-1945: World War II and Computing Breakthroughs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With the outbreak of World War II, Hopper joined the United States Navy Reserve in 1943.</li>
                        <li>She was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance's Computation Project at Harvard University.</li>
                        <li>Hopper worked on the Mark I computer, a massive electromechanical machine used for complex calculations during the war.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>1947: The First "Bug" and Computer Debugging</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While working on the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947, Hopper encountered a malfunction caused by a moth stuck in a relay.</li>
                        <li>She humorously referred to the moth as the first "bug" in a computer system, leading to the term "debugging" for identifying and fixing errors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>1952-1954: Invention of the Compiler</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hopper's groundbreaking work led to the development of the first compiler, a program that translates human-readable instructions into machine code.</li>
                        <li>This invention revolutionized programming, making it more accessible and enabling software to be written in high-level languages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>1959-1961: COBOL and Advancing Programming Languages</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hopper played a pivotal role in the development of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language).</li>
                        <li>COBOL became the first widely used high-level programming language, simplifying business application development.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>1967-1971: Advocate for Women in Technology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hopper was a passionate advocate for women in technology, fighting to create opportunities and remove barriers.</li>
                        <li>She co-founded the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and served as its first president.</li>
                        <li>Hopper inspired generations of women to pursue careers in computing through her lectures, mentorship, and leadership.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>1986-1992: Legacy and Lasting Impact</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After retiring from the Navy as a rear admiral in 1986, Hopper continued to contribute to the field of computing.</li>
                        <li>She received numerous accolades and honors for her groundbreaking work, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.</li>
                        <li>Grace Hopper passed away on January 1, 1992, leaving behind a powerful and enduring legacy.</li>
                    </ul>
